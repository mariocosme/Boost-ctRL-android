# Roadmap
This roadmap isn't final and always susceptible to changes depending on current priorities/availability

## Version 1.0.0
The basics so that the app can be released in the Google Play Store so that it can be useful for the RL esport fans without any neat features
- Implement Info fragment
- Add in-app-purchases as tips for the developer
- When no person is found (ex: Maaivy) 200 is returned with {}. Show toast saying nothing was found instead of the general error message

## Version 1.0.1
- Add more news providers (like [rocketeers.gg](https://rocketeers.gg/))
- Add Realm support to cache data so that it's possible to present something even offline
- Add desktop icon actions in order to open directly one of the main fragments
- Add left/right swipe support for recycler view items
- Add select default main screen when app is started

## Version 1.0.2
- Add favorite support to rankings so the favorites appear on the top
- Texts localization (depending on help)

## For the future aka _great to have_
- Overall update to the UI/UX (depending on extra help)
- Tablet dedicated UI and tested layouts (if needed)
- Add notifications settings
- Polls before series on who is going to win
- Polls after tournaments or days for MVP?
