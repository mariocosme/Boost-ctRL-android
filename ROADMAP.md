# Roadmap
This roadmap isn't final and always susceptible to changes depending on current priorities/availability

## Version 1.0.0
The basics so that the app can be released in the Google Play Store so that it can be useful for the RL esport fans without any neat features
- Add an internet connection listener which shows a small informative view if the user doesn't have an active connection
- Add share action to the news detail item action bar

## Version 1.0.1
- Add Realm support to cache data so that it's possible to present something even offline
- Add desktop icon actions in order to open directly one of the main fragments
- Add images for the news items supported with [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- Add left/right swipe support for recycler view items
- Add share action for each news item

## Version 1.0.2
- Texts localization (depending on help)
- Add more news providers (like [rocketeers.gg](https://rocketeers.gg/))

## For the future aka _great to have_
- Overall update to the UI/UX (depending on extra help)
- Tablet dedicated UI and tested layouts (if needed)
