- Add share action to the news detail item action bar
- Add images for the news items supported with [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)

## Version 1.0.1
- Add Realm support to cache data so that it's possible to present something even offline
- Add desktop icon actions in order to open directly one of the main fragments
- Add left/right swipe support for recycler view items
- Add select default main screen when app is started

## Version 1.0.2
- Texts localization (depending on help)
- Add more news providers (like [rocketeers.gg](https://rocketeers.gg/))

## For the future aka _great to have_
- Overall update to the UI/UX (depending on extra help)
